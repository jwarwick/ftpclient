[GCC]Ftp client library!
===================

I need to work with Ftp, so after looking for various libraries, I accidentally like the MSVC library in codeproject and write down how to create an Ftp client using this library. Instead, I chose to compile and use it with **GCC**. I modified the errors and the warnings in a somewhat old fashion, not to say what the code itself is.

The original source code from [**codeproject**][1] -- [source site][2]

> **Note:**
I compiled and built for Windows, but I haven't compiled and built on Unix or Linux yet.
It can be run enough on a Unix or Linux system. You can try cross compiling by referring to the Definements.h file.
